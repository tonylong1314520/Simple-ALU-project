COMMENTS: (required) The project overall was not that bad, I did not spend to much time on the logicworks
and the verilog. I did get stuck on the vhdl code because it was extremely different than any language I have every seen
but I asked many questions on piazza and finally figured out everything by myself. So in a way, the people that answered
my questions helped me get started, especially understanding what a bitwise XOR is. The total time I spent on this
project was approximately 2 days so it was not that bad when I finally understood how to make testbenches and see my outputs.
I feel like next time when you assign this project, you should also send testbenches with the verilog/vhdl code because
I don't think a lot of people in the 260 class checked their outputs, especially on the VHDL file..
